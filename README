This is my ST-simple terminal build.

It is not fully-featured, just the-stuff-I-use kind of featured.

Revelant patches are the scroll one, the one that matches the color of the cursos with the text, and
some others that I have a hard time remembering.

A great feature is that the background is #8baccc, whis basically is my favorite color.
